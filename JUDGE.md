# JUDGE

Independent fidelity reviews, one per phase. The judge is a separate agent
briefed as an Xbox 360 dashboard engineer, never the implementer. FAIL blocks
the phase; the loop is fix, re-judge, until PASS. Findings are numbered and
each is closed with what changed.

## Phase A, extraction — Judge A

- **2026-09-02, round 1: FAIL.** Bytes certified (3,820/3,820 unpacked
  entries hash-match their pack ranges, 29/29 resources exact, 3,234 string
  tables parse to EOF, 16/16 audio durations exact, devkit twin 6719 has
  byte-identical resources). Findings: (1) `fetch-archive.ts` and
  `build-xex1tool.sh` promised by README did not exist; (2) `unpack-xuiz.ts`
  dropped its first argument without `--out` and still printed PASS; (3) the
  `--probe` check could not fail; (4) a partial dump passed because no step
  asserted counts; (5) the docs said locale directories hold only keyed
  tables (231 positional and 11 named tables live there too); (6) one XMA
  resampled 44.1→48 kHz undocumented; (7) audio manifest entries hash the
  source, undocumented; (8) "zero misses" was a subset statistic.
- **Round 2 @ ccd4e51: PASS.** All eight closed and re-verified (the probe
  was proven live with a synthetic pack carrying a hidden PNG). Residuals
  fixed after the verdict: the stale kind-2 wording in LEARNINGS, and a
  non-XUIZ input now reports NOT_XUIZ instead of a stack trace.

## Phase B, parser and registry — Judge B

- **2026-09-02, round 1: FAIL** (decoder could not be broken; registry and
  claims could). Findings: XuiElement short of XuiTool's definition count
  (every object writes four mask bytes); XuiEffect/XuiTransition table
  swapped; five non-class registrations; XuiFall07BOTDScene undersized;
  compound packed byte ignored; XUIHelper diff blind to high bytes; broken
  `xur2json <file>`; dead `transparent` code; overstated LEARNINGS claims.
- **Round 2 @ ccd4e51: PASS.** All fourteen closed; the mask-byte and
  packed-count assertions were proven to fire with deliberately wrong
  registries, the XuiEffect binding was re-derived from the binary's call
  graph, and the independent STRN walk covers all 263 scenes. Non-blocking
  notes recorded in README: the mask-byte check proves ceil(N/8), not N,
  and skips classes that never set a property; XuiElement 17-26 are
  XuiTool's 9199 list, unexercised here.

## Phase C, static render (M0/M1) — Judge C

- **2026-09-02, round 1 @ dabf0b6: FAIL** (geometry PASS, honesty FAIL).
  Verified clean: legend discs within 0.6 px on two frames, horizontal text
  advances within 1%, figure point scaling adjudicated (bbox -> WxH),
  anchor arithmetic, 263 scenes with zero unknown classes or TextStyle
  bits. Findings: (1) text 6.1% too tall with an unsupported em derivation;
  (2) canvas hardcoded 1120x770 but 61 scenes use other sizes; (3)
  BlendMode 2-5 paint content scenes, unverified; (4) metapane resting
  state hides all chrome, undisclosed; (5) default route shows only the
  blade background (tabs at Opacity 0), undisclosed; (6) StrokeWidth not
  scaled with the geometry; (7) PLACEHOLDERS' file:// claim fires nowhere;
  (8) data-xui-state records the requested, not resolved, state; (9) 27
  overflowing figures mis-scale gradient space; (10) defaults hardcoded
  outside xuiEnums. Fixes in progress.

## Phase D, timelines (M2) — Judge D

- **2026-09-02, round 1 @ 528f5ef: FAIL.** Verified clean: keyframe
  sampling exact on six timelines incl. quaternion slerp and indexed
  gradient stops, every named-frame command on the exact tick, blade-switch
  durations against the console (20 and 22 timeline frames), the 60 Hz
  fixed-step clock. Findings: (1) the ease curve is inverted (console
  accelerates into a blade open, ours decelerated); (2) EaseIn/EaseOut
  parsed unsigned (-100 arrived as 156) — fixed in packages/xur; (3) the
  "all eases are 0/0/50" claim was false (85% carry real values); (4)
  scopes with timelines but no named frames never play (the background
  animations); (5) range labels name frames that do not exist; (6) the
  reference capture is 30 fps frame-doubled, now noted.
- **Round 2 @ c188d18: PASS.** Ease direction, parsing and the corpus
  distribution re-verified independently (blade_1_grey_rt at frame 225
  matches the hand computation to six digits); ambient scopes advance and
  loop; range labels resolve; all round-1 Linear/None samples unchanged.
  Observation for the input phase: driving frames on the M3a page restarts
  btn_1line_icon's Focus range early, so something in the focus layer
  re-triggers setState mid-range.
